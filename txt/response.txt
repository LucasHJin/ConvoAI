Yes, dynamic programming is a method used in computer science to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It involves storing the results of subproblems so that they do not need to be recalculated each time they are encountered. This can greatly improve the efficiency of algorithms and reduce the time complexity of solving a problem.
