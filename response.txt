As an employee, I would say that my biggest weaknesses are my tendency to be a perfectionist and my struggle with prioritizing tasks. I have a strong attention to detail and a desire to deliver flawless work, but sometimes this can lead me to spend too much time on a single task, causing me to fall behind on other important projects. I am working on improving my time management skills and learning to delegate tasks more effectively to ensure that I am able to meet all deadlines and deliver high-quality work consistently.
